## Viewing Markdown Files Locally

To enhance your experience with markdown files in this repository, we recommend using `md-fileserver`. This tool allows you to view markdown files in your browser with additional features like syntax highlighting and automatic updates.

### Installing md-fileserver

Install md-fileserver globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g md-fileserver
```

## Usage

### Start the Local Server

In your terminal type:

```
mdstart
```

Open the given link <http://localhost:4000/?session=...> in your browser and
navigate to the markdown file.

**Note**: The local server can only be reached from your local computer on port 4000.
Any remote access from other computers to your files is denied.
An internal session is used, so you'll need to either start with a file or use the provided
link with the session parameter.
